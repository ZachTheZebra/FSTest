# FSTest
This is an attempt at a set of tests for the FS product. It contains a .feature file showing an example piece of BDD and a set of variables to produce a number of tests. 

That feature file connects to FSFruitstore.JS to execute the tests. 

In it's current state the tests fail due to an inability to get the FS.js script to produce bundles when running in the cypress browser. Given the time to figure out the root of that problem, I would then begin to create step definitions for each of the defined behaviors in the tests.
